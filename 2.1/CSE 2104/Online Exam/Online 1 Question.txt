Sample Input: (Hight Width)
                5 2
                6 3
                4 1
                4 2
                1 3

    Sample Output: (Area)
                10
                18
                4
                8
                3

                Sort Via Area (Hight * Width = Area)
                1 * 3 = 3
                4 * 1 = 4
                4 * 2 = 8
                5 * 2 = 10
                6 * 3 = 18
